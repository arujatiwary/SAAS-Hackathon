# SAAS-Hackathon
A machine learning model for detecting fake news using **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)** and **Random Forest**. BERT is leveraged for advanced **natural language processing (NLP)** to understand the contextual meaning of news articles, while Random Forest helps in robust classification. The model achieves **around 99% accuracy**, demonstrating high efficiency in distinguishing between real and fake news. The repository includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment steps.
